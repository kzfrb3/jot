To make more posts, just keep appending to this file. Put `{end}` on a line between posts, and a YAML document with `slug` and `stamp` on the top of each post, set off by the customary `---`. (`slug` can be any arbitrary unique string. Personally, I favor random 7-digit hex codes.)

Copypasta boilerplate for adding a new post:
