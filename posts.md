Stupid blog is stupid. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) is kinda neat, tho.

I think what I'd really like is to be able to keep all the posts in a single file, that I can just keep appending to. The build script should be able to parse the individual posts out. I guess I could probably find a way to do this in JS and plug it in to 11ty, but can't help wondering if it wouldn't be easier to roll my own in python.

Really not sure yet what I'm doing with this, except that I want it to be really lightweight, quick, easy blogging for short posts. A "microblog" without any "social" aspects. Just an old-fashioned blog, if you will.

And but so I was getting some weird failed builds trying to build from gitlab push. Let's see how this one goes (if you're reading this, it worked!)

Welp, I wanted it, so I did it. Eleventy [was indeed](53a1559.html) cool, but since I'm all about short posts here, I [wrote my own Python code](https://github.com/tym-xqo/jot) to generate this site from a single file. It's a very simple script, that just uses [Markown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), and a [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) template.

I've actually thought about doing something like this for some time, so I'm glad I was finally motivated to get around to it.

Having so far posted only meta details about the blog itself, I figured I'd skip ahead and go straight to the ["sorry I haven't posted"](http://sorry.coryarcangel.com/) post.

Posting from my phone, because I can, and this is how.

So, last night I was walking to the train, and carrying a rubber band ball that I made. I was right at Canal and Madison, and the ball slipped out of my hand and bounced off into the street. I felt a little silly, but there was a lot of traffic, so I gave it up for lost and just watched it bounce away. As I was crossing Canal, a middle aged African American woman—who had seen the whole thing—smiled at me. I laughed back, and shrugged. It was a whole moment.

Geeking out, today I:

1. Added a development server to [my blog script](https://github.com/tym-xqo/xqo.wtf) with [livereload](https://livereload.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make trying out local builds easier
2. Switched my default shell from `fish` to `zsh` and used [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) to get the crazy-cool [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme installed. I feel more techy-studly-cool already.

I got new glasses last night: nicer frame, new prescription, and the lenses are workspace progressives—with larger intermediate and near focus areas than my old ones. I'm really digging them. Wearing them feels like a significant life upgrade, and there's been virtually no getting used to them difficulty.
