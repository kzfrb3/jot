Stupid blog is stupid. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) is kinda neat, tho.

I think what I'd really like is to be able to keep all the posts in a single file, that I can just keep appending to. The build script should be able to parse the individual posts out. I guess I could probably find a way to do this in JS and plug it in to 11ty, but can't help wondering if it wouldn't be easier to roll my own in python.

Really not sure yet what I'm doing with this, except that I want it to be really lightweight, quick, easy blogging for short posts. A "microblog" without any "social" aspects. Just an old-fashioned blog, if you will.

And but so I was getting some weird failed builds trying to build from gitlab push. Let's see how this one goes (if you're reading this, it worked!)

Welp, I wanted it, so I did it. Eleventy [was indeed](53a1559.html) cool, but since I'm all about short posts here, I [wrote my own Python code](https://github.com/tym-xqo/jot) to generate this site from a single file. It's a very simple script, that just uses [Markown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), and a [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) template.

I've actually thought about doing something like this for some time, so I'm glad I was finally motivated to get around to it.

Having so far posted only meta details about the blog itself, I figured I'd skip ahead and go straight to the ["sorry I haven't posted"](http://sorry.coryarcangel.com/) post.

So, last night I was walking to the train, and carrying a rubber band ball that I made. I was right at Canal and Madison, and the ball slipped out of my hand and bounced off into the street. I felt a little silly, but there was a lot of traffic, so I gave it up for lost and just watched it bounce away. As I was crossing Canal, a middle aged African American woman—who had seen the whole thing—smiled at me. I laughed back, and shrugged. It was a whole moment.

Geeking out, today I:

1. Added a development server to [my blog script](https://github.com/tym-xqo/xqo.wtf) with [livereload](https://livereload.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make trying out local builds easier
2. Switched my default shell from `fish` to `zsh` and used [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) to get the crazy-cool [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme installed. I feel more techy-studly-cool already.

I got new glasses last night: nicer frame, new prescription, and the lenses are workspace progressives—with larger intermediate and near focus areas than my old ones. I'm really digging them. Wearing them feels like a significant life upgrade, and there's been virtually no getting used to them difficulty.

Dang. If I had had any idea how comfortable and well-made Wayfarers actually are, I would have invested in a pair long ago.

I spend a lot of time ruminating. It's complicated, but I believe one of the factors is I've been through a lot of things where I felt like I never got closure. I think it's related to my sensitivity; my expectations and standards for closure are pretty high, and my discomfort at not getting it can be acute. So I tend to feel like I'm walking around with a lot of loose ends, things that didn't turn out the way I wanted them too, and that left me not knowing how to move on. Like I say, it’s hardly the only reason I’m given to rumination, but it’s a big one.

So and but anyway, I realized today I can just declare bankruptcy on ALL of that. Closure bankruptcy. So that relationship ended badly, or this one friend stopped returning my calls. Not everything gets tied up with a tidy bow, and I rarely get to understand the reasons why. No amount of rumination is going to change those stories or bring the closure to them that I wish they had. But I can move on from every single one of them at once by just declaring that it’s time. I’m sure they’ll still pop up frequently, asking me to dig into another good rumination session, but I can just refer them to the bankruptcy court, like they were bad debt collectors. I gotta do something to get them all off my back.

Just realizing I can up my [closure bankruptcy](b90bfa9) to rumination bankruptcy in general. Anything that suggests itself to my thoughts as a topic for repetitive cogitation, I will politely ask to take it up with the judge. I don't have time for any of that.

Observation: so-called "open" office layouts discourage or militate against an [open focus](https://openfocus.com/home/) style of attention. There's too much distraction and noise; narrow-objective focus must be maintained in order to get anything done. It becomes inherently stressful just to sit at a desk because of the amount of background filtering one has to do just to get through the day.
