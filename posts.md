Stupid blog is stupid. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) is kinda neat, tho.

I think what I'd really like is to be able to keep all the posts in a single file, that I can just keep appending to. The build script should be able to parse the individual posts out. I guess I could probably find a way to do this in JS and plug it in to 11ty, but can't help wondering if it wouldn't be easier to roll my own in python.

Really not sure yet what I'm doing with this, except that I want it to be really lightweight, quick, easy blogging for short posts. A "microblog" without any "social" aspects. Just an old-fashioned blog, if you will.

And but so I was getting some weird failed builds trying to build from gitlab push. Let's see how this one goes (if you're reading this, it worked!)
